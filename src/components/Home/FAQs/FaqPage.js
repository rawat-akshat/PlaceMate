      question:
        "What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java?",
      answer:
        "An abstract class in Java can have both abstract and concrete methods. It can also have instance variables. Interfaces, on the other hand, can only have abstract methods (prior to Java 8). An interface cannot contain instance variables, and all its methods are implicitly public and abstract. Additionally, a class can implement multiple interfaces but can only extend one abstract class. Abstract classes are used to provide a common base implementation for subclasses, while interfaces are used to define contracts that classes must adhere to.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Explain the concept of polymorphism in object-oriented programming.",
      answer:
        "Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. There are two main types of polymorphism: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. Compile-time polymorphism, also known as method overloading, allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters to coexist in a class. Runtime polymorphism, also known as method overriding, occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. Polymorphism promotes code reusability, flexibility, and extensibility in object-oriented systems.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What is the difference between a stack and a queue data structure?",
      answer:
        "A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. It supports two main operations: push (adds an element to the top of the stack) and pop (removes the top element from the stack). On the other hand, a queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. It supports two main operations: enqueue (adds an element to the rear of the queue) and dequeue (removes the front element from the queue). Stacks are used in scenarios such as function call management, expression evaluation, and undo operations, while queues are used in scenarios such as job scheduling, breadth-first search, and resource allocation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are design patterns in software engineering?",
      answer:
        "Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered during software development. They represent best practices and proven solutions that can be applied to various design and implementation challenges. Design patterns provide a common language for developers to communicate and share solutions, promote code maintainability and scalability, and help in creating flexible and modular software architectures. Some popular design patterns include Singleton, Factory, Adapter, Observer, Strategy, and Composite patterns.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Explain the concept of Big O notation and its significance in algorithm analysis.",
      answer:
        "Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm in terms of the input size. It provides an upper bound on the worst-case time or space complexity of an algorithm as the input size approaches infinity. Big O notation allows developers to analyze and compare the efficiency of algorithms without having to consider implementation details or hardware differences. It helps in identifying algorithms that scale well with increasing input sizes and allows for making informed decisions regarding algorithm selection and optimization. Common Big O complexities include O(1) (constant time), O(log n) (logarithmic time), O(n) (linear time), O(n log n) (linearithmic time), O(n^2) (quadratic time), and O(2^n) (exponential time).",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the role of a virtual function in C++?",
      answer:
        "A virtual function in C++ is a member function that is declared as virtual in a base class and can be overridden in derived classes. When a virtual function is invoked using a pointer or reference to a base class object, the actual implementation of the function is determined at runtime based on the type of the object being pointed to or referenced. This enables polymorphic behavior, allowing objects of different derived classes to be treated uniformly through a common base class interface. Virtual functions are used to achieve runtime polymorphism in C++ and facilitate dynamic method dispatch.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of garbage collection in Java?",
      answer:
        "Garbage collection in Java is a mechanism for automatically reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use or reachable by the application. It helps in preventing memory leaks and managing memory efficiently by reclaiming resources allocated to objects that are no longer needed. The garbage collector periodically scans the heap memory, identifies unreferenced objects, and deallocates their memory space, making it available for reuse",
